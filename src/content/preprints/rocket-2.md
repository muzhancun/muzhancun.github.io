## Abstract

We present ROCKET-2, a state-of-the-art Minecraft Agent supporting cross-view goal specification. This work builds upon our previous ROCKET framework and introduces novel techniques for steering visuomotor policies through cross-view goal alignment.

## Key Contributions

1. **Cross-View Goal Specification**: Novel approach to goal specification that works across different viewing angles and perspectives.

2. **Visuomotor Policy Steering**: Advanced techniques for steering policies based on visual input and motor actions.

3. **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Demonstrates superior performance on various Minecraft tasks compared to existing methods.

## Methodology

Our approach combines several key innovations:

- Cross-view alignment mechanisms
- Robust goal conditioning
- Multi-modal fusion techniques
- Hierarchical policy learning

## Results

ROCKET-2 achieves significant improvements over baseline methods on standard Minecraft benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our cross-view goal alignment approach.

## Future Work

We plan to extend this work to other domains beyond Minecraft and explore applications in real-world robotics scenarios.
