## Abstract

We present a novel contextual combinatorial bandit approach for automated negotiation in multi-agent settings. Our method addresses the challenge of learning effective negotiation strategies when the opponent's behavior and preferences are unknown.

## Introduction

Automated negotiation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging from resource allocation to market trading. Traditional approaches often assume perfect information about opponent preferences, which is unrealistic in many real-world scenarios.

## Problem Formulation

We formalize the negotiation problem as a contextual combinatorial bandit where:
- **Actions**: Negotiation offers (combinations of items/terms)
- **Context**: Current negotiation state and opponent behavior history
- **Rewards**: Negotiation outcomes (acceptance/rejection and utility)

## Method

### Contextual Combinatorial Bandit Framework

Our approach extends the combinatorial bandit setting to incorporate:

1. **Context-aware Policy**: Learns to adapt strategies based on negotiation context
2. **Combinatorial Action Space**: Handles complex offer structures
3. **Online Learning**: Adapts to opponent behavior during negotiation

### Algorithm Design

The core algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Context Extraction**: Extract relevant features from current negotiation state
2. **Offer Generation**: Use upper confidence bounds to select promising offers
3. **Response Learning**: Update model based on opponent's response
4. **Strategy Adaptation**: Refine negotiation strategy over time

## Theoretical Analysis

We provide regret bounds for our algorithm, showing:
- **Sublinear Regret**: O(âˆšT log T) regret with respect to optimal strategy
- **Context Adaptation**: Improved bounds when context is informative
- **Combinatorial Efficiency**: Polynomial dependence on action space complexity

## Experimental Results

### Simulated Environments
- **Bilateral Negotiation**: Consistent improvements over baseline strategies
- **Multi-issue Negotiation**: Effective handling of complex negotiation spaces
- **Opponent Adaptation**: Quick adaptation to different opponent types

### Real-world Application
- **Online Marketplace**: Improved success rates in automated trading
- **Resource Allocation**: Better outcomes in distributed resource sharing

## Key Contributions

1. **Novel Formulation**: First to cast negotiation as contextual combinatorial bandit
2. **Theoretical Guarantees**: Rigorous analysis with regret bounds
3. **Practical Algorithm**: Efficient implementation with strong empirical performance
4. **Broad Applicability**: Demonstrated effectiveness across multiple domains

## Related Work

Our work builds upon:
- Combinatorial bandits literature
- Game-theoretic approaches to negotiation
- Online learning in multi-agent systems

## Conclusion

We have presented a principled approach to automated negotiation using contextual combinatorial bandits. Our method provides both theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements, opening new directions for research in multi-agent learning.
